# CS-Homework

This is a homework assigment of mine. It has 9 tasks related to arrays and 1 small game. Here are the requirements for each one of the tasks:

Task 1:
Write a program that creates an array which has 20 elements.
The elements have to be integers.
Every element has to have value equal to the index value and multiplied by 5.
Print the elements on the console.

Task 2:
Write a program that prints the values of the odd numbered indexes of an array.

Task 3:
Write a program that checks whether an array is symmetrical.

Task 4:
Write a program, which creates an array with all the English letters.
Let the user input a word in the console.
The program has to output the indexes of the letters in the user's word.

Task 5:
Write a program which takes the elements of a given array and outputs them backwards.

Task 6:
Write a program which reads two arrays and outputs whether their elements are equal.

Task 7:
Write a program that shows the most frequently seen element in an array.

Task 8:
Write a program, which creates an array, the length of which is chosen by the user.
The user has to input values for each one of the elements of the array.
Then they have to pick how many of the elements they want summed and how many of them - multiplied.

Task 9:
Write a program, which generate a random integer array with a random size.
Sort the array. Find how many times the array size is found as an element in the array.
Find the sum and the product of the array elements.

The game:
Just a game where the computer thinks of a random number in the range of 1 to 1000.
The user has to pick 3 numbers which will get summed.
If the sum is in range of -100 to 100 from the computer's number - they win, otherwise - they lose.
